# UART Loopback

[中文版本](./README_CN.md)

Small UART example that sends text from TX and reads it back on RX.

## Difficulty

Beginner to intermediate.

## Hardware Required

- One ESP32-P4 board.
- One jumper wire between the configured TX and RX pins.

## Default Pins

| Signal | Default GPIO |
| --- | --- |
| TX | GPIO43 |
| RX | GPIO44 |

Change these in `idf.py menuconfig` if the pins conflict with your board.

## Configuration Notes

The default UART port is UART1 at 115200 baud. This is separate from the USB
serial monitor used for flashing and logs, so the loopback jumper must be
placed between the configured TX and RX GPIOs.

Use 3.3 V UART wiring only. For board bring-up, keep the jumper short and avoid
GPIOs already used by the board's display, SD card, camera, or debug port.

## Build and Flash

```bash
cd examples/esp-idf/07_uart_loopback
idf.py set-target esp32p4
idf.py menuconfig
idf.py build
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

## Expected Output

With TX connected to RX:

```text
received 33 bytes: hello from esp32-p4 uart loopback
```

Without the jumper, the example prints a warning.

## What to Reuse

- `uart_driver_install()`
- `uart_param_config()`
- `uart_set_pin()`
- `uart_write_bytes()` and `uart_read_bytes()`
- A simple timeout-based check for wiring or pin-selection mistakes.
